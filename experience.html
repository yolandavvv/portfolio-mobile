    <h1>San Shi Go</h1>
    <p>
      I lived in Irvine before I moved to Ann Arbor this summer. During my time in California, I will say Omakase is my favorite fine dining.
      I tried many Michelin guide chef's restaurant, and I'll say San Shi Go in Newport Beach is my favorite one in the Orange County though it is not in the list of Michelin Guide yet.
      It is a very traditional Japanese restaurant, and their chef Mr. Markodo is so passionate that you can definitely feel how he loves sushi and his restaurant.
      As I go their restaurant more and more often, the chef has already remembered what fish I will like and what kind of ingredients can give me surprise. I am really happy I enjoy my meals very time.
      I love this place not only because its artistic foods but also the happy air here. We drink and chat with chefs together. Yea, I am quite miss this treasure place.
